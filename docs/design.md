## Introduction
The purpose of this package is to provide a robust set of tools for working with the rich datasets provided by the Wide Swath Radar Altimeter (WSRA). The WSRA routinely flies into tropical cyclones aboard the Hurricane Hunter aircraft, scanning the sea surface to estimate the roughness and the directional wave spectrum beneath the flight path.



The aim is to enable and encourage researchers across all career stages to explore these data by lowering the barrier to their access and use. This is achieved through example, and by providing tools for input/output, screening, and visualization.


In tandem, a goal is to



twofold: to spur the use of the rich datasets provided by the Wide Swath Radar Altimeter which flies into tropical cyclones aboard the Hurricane Hunter aircraft, and to provide a robust set of tools for
